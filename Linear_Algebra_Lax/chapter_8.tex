\section{Spectral Theory of Selfadjoint Mappings of a Euclidean Space Into Itself}

\subsection{Exercise 1}
This is only true when $(y, My)$ is real, since
\begin{align*}
        (y, \frac{M + M^{*}}{2}y) &= \frac{1}{2} (y, My) + \frac{1}{2} \overline{(y, My)} \\
                                  &= \Re (y, My)
\end{align*}

\subsection{Exercise 2}
Algorithm is described by Lax; I'll pass on coding.

\subsection{Exercise 3}
Let $S$ be the max subspace such that $q \geq 0$ and $S_+$ be the max subspace such that $q > 0$.
Then the nullspace of the mapping $P: S \to S_+$ defined as setting the first $p_+$ elements of a vector to 0 
consists of those vectors for which $q = 0$. Since the dimension of this nullspace is $p_0$, we have the
desired result. Showing the same for $S_-$ is analogous.
