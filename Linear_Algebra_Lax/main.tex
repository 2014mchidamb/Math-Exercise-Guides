\begin{quote}
        \textit{``A modern mathematical proof is not very different from a modern machine,
or a modern test setup: the simple fundamental principles are hidden 
and almost invisible under a mass of technical details.''} - Hermann Weyl
\end{quote}

These notes contain short summaries of (my) proof ideas for exercises
and some theorems from the book \textit{Linear Algebra} by Peter Lax.
I have tried to make the summaries as brief as possible; sometimes only one direction of proof, 
one line, or even one equation. My goal was to include enough information in the summaries so that
someone reading would be able to reconstruct a full proof with all the details if necessary.
However, these summaries are tuned to my own personal context, and as such I'm sure mileage will vary.
I would greatly appreciate any feedback/fixes.

Also, I like when people include (what they presume to be) relevant quotes in their notes, so I have to ask you to forgive my haughtiness in starting these notes with a quote from Hermann Weyl.
