\begin{quote}
        \textit{``A modern mathematical proof is not very different from a modern machine,
or a modern test setup: the simple fundamental principles are hidden 
and almost invisible under a mass of technical details.''} - Hermann Weyl
\end{quote}

These notes contain short summaries of my proof ideas for exercises
from the book \textit{Linear Algebra} by Peter Lax.
Note that this is not the same book as Lax's more recent \textit{Linear Algebra And Its Applications}.
I think the latter book has solutions floating around, but I could not find solutions for this
older book... So perhaps someone will find something useful in what follows.
