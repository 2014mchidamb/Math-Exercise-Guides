\section*{About}

\begin{quote}
        \textit{``A modern mathematical proof is not very different from a modern machine,
or a modern test setup: the simple fundamental principles are hidden 
and almost invisible under a mass of technical details.''} - Hermann Weyl
\end{quote}

These notes contain short summaries of (my) proof ideas for exercises
and some theorems from the book \textit{Linear Algebra} by Peter Lax.
I have tried to make the summaries as brief as possible, sometimes only one line or one equation.
My hope is that the summaries will give enough information to reconstruct a full proof without bogging the reader down with details. 
In many cases, I am sure that I inadvertently sacrificed clarity in an attempt to obtain brevity, and would greatly appreciate any feedback.

Also, I like when people include (what they presume to be) relevant quotes in their notes, so I have to ask you to forgive my haughtiness in starting these notes with a quote from Hermann Weyl.
