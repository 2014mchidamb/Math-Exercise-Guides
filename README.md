My solutions to exercises across several math/CS textbooks. Also, some brief reviews.

Disclaimer: Completion percentages are from memory and may not actually be accurate.

## *Algebra* by Garrett Birkhoff and Saunders MacLane

**Status:** ~50-60% of exercises in chapters 1 and 2.

**Review:** Enjoying the progression/setup of topics so far in this book. Most people recommended Dummit & Foote, but I've personally found *Algebra* to be a more enjoyable read. Exercises feel a little on the easier side.

## *Calculus on Manifolds* by Michael Spivak

**Status:** ~60% of exercises in chapter 1, chapter 2 in progress.

**Review:** Love the brevity of this book. Nice range of exercises after each section, with many exercises being important results that Spivak refers to over and over again as he develops the material. My only complaint so far is that some of the notation is a bit cumbersome.

## *Complex Analysis* by Lars Ahlfors

**Status:** Some exercises in chapter 1, just started chapter 2.

**Review:** Can't say I've liked this book so far. Chapter 1 had a bunch of tedious exercises that I chose to skip, and the ones I chose to do didn't feel illuminating. Still, enough people have heaped praise on this book that I'll try to stick with it.

## *Elements of Statistical Learning* by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman

**Status:** I've done the first exercise.

## *Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions* by Frederick Mosteller

**Status:** ~10% complete.

**Review:** Fun problems.

## *Lecture Notes on Elementary Topology and Geometry* by Isadore Singer and John Thorpe

**Status:** Started reading chapter 1, but there are no exercises.

## *Linear Algebra* by Peter Lax

**Note:** this book is not the same as *Linear Algebra and its Applications* by Lax.

**Status:** 100% of exercises in chapters 1-9.

**Review:** Huge fan of the bite-sized chapter format, and I really like the exposition. Unfortunately, this book has very few exercises per chapter, and most of the exercises are quite straightforward.

## *Nature of Computation* by Christopher Moore and Stephan Mertens

**Status:** 100% of exercises in chapters 1-3 and a handful of problems in chapters 1-3.

**Review:** Amazing book, reads like a novel. Really appreciate the historical background woven into each section, as well as the in-text exercises for keeping the reader on their toes. Also, the end-of-chapter problems look awesome; I need to do more of them.

## *Principles of Mathematical Analysis* by Walter Rudin

**Status:** ~50% of exercises in chapters 1-7.

**Review:** Many, many reviews have been written about this book. I personally love it; the chapters are relatively short and the exercises have definitely strengthened my grasp on analysis.

## *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto

**Status:** 100% of exercises in chapter 1.

## *Statistical Inference* by George Casella and Richard Berger

**Status:** ~20% of exercises in chapters 1-3.

**Review:** Don't really like the writing, but has lots of exercises and each chapter is packed with information. Feels pretty comprehensive.
