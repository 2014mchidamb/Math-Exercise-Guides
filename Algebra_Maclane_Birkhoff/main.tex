What follows are short summaries of my solution ideas (most of them aren't really proofs) to exercises
from the book \textit{Algebra} (2nd Edition) by Saunders MacLane and Garrett Birkhoff.
I used the 2nd Edition due to having access to a hard copy; the exercises/exposition through the majority
of the 2nd and 3rd Editions are identical as far as I can tell.
