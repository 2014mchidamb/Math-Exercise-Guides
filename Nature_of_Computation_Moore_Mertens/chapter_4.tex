\subsubsection{Exercise 1}
If a 2-coloring of a graph exists, then we can flip all of the colors in the graph to produce another valid
two-coloring. Thus, we can proceed to construct a two-coloring by picking an uncolored vertex and then coloring
it an arbitrary color, which then determines the colors of all of the veritces it is connected to. We do
this until either the graph is completely colored, or until we need to recolor an already colored vertex
(in which case the graph is not 2-colorable). This algorithm is linear in the number of edges of the graph, so 2-coloring is in $P$.
