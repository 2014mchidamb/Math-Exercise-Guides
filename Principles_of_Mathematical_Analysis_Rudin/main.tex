        \textit{``It is not possible to overstate how good this book is. I tried to give it uncountably many stars but they only have five. Five is an insult. I'm sorry Dr. Rudin...''} - \href{https://www.amazon.com/review/R23MC2PCAJYHCB}{Amazon Review}
\end{quote}

An actual solution manual for the book can be found \href{https://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/67009}{here}.
What follows are notes I took as I did exercises (they're more like hints towards my thinking than
solutions) while working through the book on my own.
