\begin{quote}
        \textit{``A modern mathematical proof is not very different from a modern machine,
or a modern test setup: the simple fundamental principles are hidden 
and almost invisible under a mass of technical details.''} - Hermann Weyl
\end{quote}

An actual solution manual for the book can be found \href{https://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/67009}{here}.
What follows are notes I took as I did exercises (they're more like hints towards my thinking than
solutions) while working through the book on my own.
