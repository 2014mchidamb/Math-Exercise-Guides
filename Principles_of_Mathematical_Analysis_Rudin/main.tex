\begin{quote}
        \textit{``The calculus was the first achievement of modern mathematics and it is difficult to overestimate its importance. I think it defines more unequivocally than anything else the inception of modern mathematics; and the system of mathematical analysis, which is its logical development, still constitutes the greatest technical advance in exact thinking.''} - John von Neumann
\end{quote}

An actual solution manual for the book can be found \href{https://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/67009}{here}.
What follows are notes I took as I did exercises (they're more like hints towards my thinking than
solutions) while working through the book on my own.
